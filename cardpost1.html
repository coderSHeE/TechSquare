     <p>These great business ideas offer opportunities for entrepreneurs who are looking to start something new, whether you’ve run a business before or are looking to launch your first company.</p>
     <p>
     <li>Many of the best small business ideas involve an online business model.</li>
     <li>Choose a business idea that you are knowledgeable and passionate about, and develop a detailed business plan.</li>
     <li>
      Before starting a business, determine if there is a demand for the product or service you want to provide.
     </li>
     </p>
     <p><em>This article is for anyone looking for inspiration to start a business.</em></p>
     
     <p>If you are <em>thinking about starting a business</em>, you should be considering whether your idea fills a need in the way people live their lives and approach their work. If you can identify an unmet need and a target market, then you might just have a <u>business</u> idea with legs. But how can you come up with a good idea in the first place? This list of business ideas includes 26 great types of business to help you find success.</p>
  
     <p><strong>Read on for some inspiration into the many types of businesses that could launch you to success</strong></p>

     <p>
      <li><strong>1. Resume writing</strong></li>
      People are always applying for jobs, whether they want to make a career shift, increase their pay or switch work environments. Of course, most job applications require candidates to submit resumes to detail their professional background. As a resume writer, you can help job applicants’ resumes stand out from their competition.
<br>
      You’ll also help your clients create cover letters and portfolios that show off the best of their work. Plus, you don’t need any special schooling to be a resume writer – just some basic organizing and proofreading skills. If you know what makes resumes appear professional and ready for employers’ eyes, you’re already off to a great start.
     </p>
  

     <p>
      <li><strong>2. Host a podcast</strong></li>

      Podcasts have become extremely popular, with more than <u>100 million active podcast listeners</u> in the U.S. alone. Best of all, you can start a podcast on any topic that interests you, from business to history to pop culture and more. Starting a podcast requires consistency and dedication, as well as a basic understanding of audio editing (and video editing if you want to start a companion YouTube channel for subscribers to follow).
      <br>

      Once your podcast has built up a substantial following, you can sell time to advertisers or establish partnerships with companies that generate revenue. As your brand expands further, you may even be able to charge to speak at events or moderate panels on topics your podcast focuses on. Of course, in order to get to that level, you need to come up with a unique idea that you’re passionate and knowledgeable about, and then make sure you can relate to your <u>target audience</u>. 

     </p>


     <p>
      <li><strong>3. Owning a food truck</strong></li>

      Food trucks come in all shapes and sizes, serving up a wide range of snacks and cuisines. Take your favorite style of food on the road, and sell your culinary passions directly to hungry customers. Sure, you’ll be working, but you’ll be in a space you’re passionate about, with a chance to connect to people who have similar interests. 
      <br>
      Starting a food truck might sound like a wild idea, but the industry is growing. The overhead and upkeep for a truck is significantly less than for a restaurant, and you have the added benefit of mobility. 

      <em>Starting a food truck business can be profitable. However, there are some startup costs to consider, such as purchasing a food truck and modifying it to meet local regulations.</em>
     </p>

     <p>
      <li><strong>4. Sell courses or webinars</strong></li>

      If you consider yourself having a skill set or abilities that are transferable and teachable, you could look at this as a serious venture. Your expertise can help others and build them that essential skill set.
      <br>
      People look at online courses to majorly upskill themselves and achieve a career change or promotion. However, some people now look at courses because they are interested in the subject and want to pursue it passionately. You have a dedicated audience ready to pay and commit to the course.

      <br>
      You can select a niche topic in the category or trending skills in the market currently. All you need is a qualifying certification or expertise to show, a camera and editing software.

      <br>
      Various platforms list your courses, like WordPress plugins and <a href="https://www.udemy.com/">Udemy</a> . If you do not want to invest in a course, you can consider webinars or workshops.
     </p>

     <p>
      <li><strong>5. Start a lending library of your own books </strong></li>

      Are you someone who hoards books? Time to lend your reads to others too. You can start an online store to sell the books you've read too many times or those you know you're not going to read anymore. In business terms, they are assets that can be monetised.
      <br>

      You can consider starting a book club and initiating book exchanges. Yet another thing you can do is start a membership library – a great way to monetise your expansive book collection without giving away the ownership of your books.

      Half Price Books, a <a href="https://www.shopify.com/in/free-trial/online?term=shopify%20shop&adid=566143385915&campaignid=15433369407&branded_enterprise=1&BOID=brand&cmadid=516585705;cmadvertiserid=10730501;cmcampaignid=26990768;cmplacementid=324494758;cmcreativeid=163722649;cmsiteid=5500011">Shopify store</a>, promotes a membership plan along with the option of purchasing used books.
