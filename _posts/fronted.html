        Front-end development, or client-side development, involves building the User Interface (UI) of a website or a web application, that determines how every part of a website will look and how it will work. The UI includes the visual part of the application and the user interactions. Whatever you see when you visit a website - the different types of buttons and other UI components, media, texts, forms, animations, etc. are all developed as a part of the front-end. Please also take a look at the details on what is markdown here.  

A Front-End Developer is a type of Software Engineer who works on front-end development. They are not only responsible for developing the UI, but they also ensure a balance between design and functionality and ensure speed and scalability. They also ensure that the website loads correctly on all browsers (cross-browser), on different operating systems (cross-platform), and on different devices like mobiles, tablets, and computer screens (cross-device). 

If you are serious about becoming a Front End Developer, you can start by signing up for a Front End Online Course.  

The tools and technologies that are used to develop the front-end of a website change constantly. The plethora of these front-end tools and frameworks often confuses beginners who are trying to step into the front end because they are unsure of what they need to learn. If you want to become a Front-End Developer and don’t know where to start, this is the right place for you. In this article, we will look at what tools, technologies, frameworks, and programming languages you need to learn. We will cover the Front End Developer roadmap. You might also find it interesting to read about the top reasons to become a full stack developer article 

Note that the front end development roadmap presented in this article is not the only way to become a Front End Developer. This is simply a guide for those who are looking to start learning Front End Development. .

    <h3>Fundamentals of Front End </h3>
    <p>For stepping into Front-End Development, the most essential skills you should have are HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. These skills are the bare minimum to start with Front-End Development. Note that front-end web development is not just limited to these three skills, there are many more technologies that you will need to learn to excel as a Front-End Developer in 2022. 

        Let us look at these fundamental skills in detail. 
        <h3>1. HTML - HyperText Markup Language   </h3>

        <p>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is used to form the “skeleton”, or the base, of any website. It lays out a website’s general structure and content. The elements that you see on the screen - buttons, images, sliders, date pickers, texts, lists, etc. are all added using HTML.  

This markup language is made up of tags that label or indicate what the content should appear as. For example, let us look at the code snippet below. </p>

<img>
<li><!DOCTYPE html> is a declaration that should be added at the start of every HTML document to indicate to the browser what type of document to expect, i.e. HTML.</li> 
<li>The HTML opening tag (<html>) and the HTML closing tag (</html>) indicate the start and end of a HTML structure.  </li>
<li> “head” tags (<head> and </head>) contain the metadata or information about the website. Not all of the metadata is visible on the website, some of them are information for the browsers. </li> 
<li>The opening and closing “title” tags (<title> and </title>) are used to give the title to your website which will be visible on the browser tab.</li> 
<li>The content between the opening and closing body tags (<body> … </body>) contains the elements that will appear on the screen. </li>
<li>The tags “h1”, “h2”, “p”, and “i” are used to format the text. </li> 
<li>The “button” tag is used to create a button with the name “Click Me!”</li> 
    </p>

    <h3>2. CSS - Cascading Style Sheets </h3>
    <p>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets using which you can add styles to your web pages like colors, fonts, layouts, and animations. With CSS, you can also make responsive websites that can change layout and styles according to the device resolution and orientation so that users have a seamless experience while using your website on devices of any size. CSS allows you to style multiple elements at once. It uses tag, class, and id selectors to target HTML elements that we want to style. We can then use these selectors to write style rules containing a property name like “font-size”, “background-color”, “margin-left”, etc. and values for these properties.</p>

    <h3>3. JavaScript</h3>
    <p>Now that we have built the layout of our website using HTML and styled it using CSS, the next step is to add “actions” to our websites. This is done using the JavaScript programming language.  It improves the interactivity of your website. You can also create dynamic UI elements using JavaScript. JavaScript adds functionality to your website. For example, opening a menu on click of a button, updating the progress in a progress bar, sending a request containing your username and password to an authentication service after you click on the “Login” button to check if you are an authorized user, etc.  With the help of JavaScript, your website can respond to user activities on the page.  

        You may consider HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as an analogy to the body of humans.  The role of the skeleton and the organs is played by HTML. The role of the appearance and looks is played by CSS - height, eye color, hair color, skin color, skin texture, face structure, the shape of the hands, etc. The bodily functions are done using JavaScript - how the digestive system works, how the nervous system works, etc. 
        
        Now that we have seen the three fundamentals of front end development, let us look at a few other fundamental skills needed for a front end developer.</p>

        <h3>4. DOM Manipulation
        </h3>
        <p>With HTML, you can create web pages with static layouts easily. However, you might need to build dynamic web pages that can change the layout on the fly.  For example, you might want to add, remove, or edit HTML elements after the web page has been loaded or you might want to modify the CSS styles of an element only when an event occurs. Such dynamic manipulation of your web page can be done using the Document Object Model (DOM) API, which is a set of APIs to control HTML and styling information. DOM Manipulation is a good-to-have skill that will help you in creating applications capable of updating the data or the layout of the page without reloading. DOM Manipulation can be done using JavaScript.</p>

        <h3>5. How the Web Works</h3>
        <p>As a front end developer, you should have a basic idea of the working of the web and the different protocols for communication over the web. It is good to have the basic idea of how the internet works, how clients and servers interact, the Domain Name Server (DNS) and the components of a website i.e code files and assets. While it is not important to know all the communication protocols in detail, the basic knowledge of these protocols will help you develop secure websites which are critical nowadays. HTTPS and SSL are two of the secure communication protocols that are good to know.  </p>

        <h3>6. Responsive Design
        </h3>
        <p>Responsive Web Design means creating websites that can be used on all types and sizes of devices. In today’s time where people use websites from all devices like laptops, large-screen computers, tablets as well as mobile phones, it becomes of utmost importance to develop responsive interfaces. This can be done using CSS Media Queries, where the style and layout of the web page change as per the device and screen size. Responsive Design automatically resizes, hides, shrinks or enlarges the components on a website. </p>
